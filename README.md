# 📘 100 Days of Machine Learning — Study & Practice

This repository documents my **Machine Learning learning journey** where I am systematically studying core ML concepts and implementing them in code.

I have already completed **~35 days of learning**, and I am now organizing all my work — notes, code, and practice exercises — into this GitHub repository for better tracking, revision, and portfolio building.

---

## 🚀 About

This repository serves as:
- A structured collection of my **Machine Learning notes**
- **Hands-on implementations** of ML algorithms
- **Practice notebooks and experiments**
- A personal reference and learning archive

The focus is on building strong **fundamentals** along with practical implementation using Python and standard ML libraries.

## 📌 What’s Inside

Each day/topic generally contains:

✔ Concept explanations & notes  
✔ Python code (Jupyter Notebooks / `.py` files)  
✔ Practice problems & mini-experiments  
✔ Datasets (when required)  
✔ Visualizations & model evaluation  


> Earlier days are added retroactively, and upcoming days will be pushed regularly.
